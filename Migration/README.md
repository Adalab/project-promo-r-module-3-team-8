# Project's title: Awesome Profile Cards Minions version

## Description

Welcome to the minion's profile card factory place! If you came to this site, you'll probably be looking, as Gru, for a good way of organizing and distinguish your own minions. I have good news, this is your place! Thanks to this intuitive web site, your workers can easily create their own profile card, with all the relevant information and social networks to be differentiated from the others, and even to share it in Twitter!

## Technologies

This web page was made using HTML5, SaSS, plain JS, localStorage and the Adalab Web Starter Kit, who uses NodeJS, Gulp and JSON.

Please, take into account that all HTML, SaSS and JS files are divided in partials. In the case of JS files, they are ordered by number following the moment the code is used. In the case of HTML and CSS, the are related, each HTML file has one SaSS file associated named after it. All of them have descriptive names according to the place of the page they are developing or working on.

## Table of contents and How to Use the Project

### Main landing

It is the welcoming page, you should click on 'Comenzar'('Start') to go the create cards page. All the other elements are static.

### Create card landing

On the left, you can see a toggled form that covers all the options you have to modified and personalized your card. This form can only open one section at a time, and to close one, you need to open another.

The sections are:

- 'Diseña'('Design'): you can choose between 3 different palettes.
- 'Rellena'('Fill'): you need to fill all the boxes so the information in your cards is updated. All fields are compulsory except the telephone number ('Teléfono'). We are not sure that all minions have one! If any of the information happens to be in an unwanted format, the box is going to become red.
  NOTE: you can add either an image or a GIF that represents you for your card.
  NOTE: in LinkedIn and GitHub boxes, you only need to add your profile, not the complete url.
- 'Comparte': allows you to create your card in two different ways: by giving you an url to share everywhere you like, or by creating for you a new twit in you Twitter account ready to be sent. If there is anything wrong with your information that you didn't detected before, this won't create your card, but to reopened the 'Rellena' section so you can fix it.

On the right, there is the preview, that means that you can see how is your card looking at any moment of the developing process.
Together with this, you can always click the reset button if you are unhappy an restart everything.

As this page works with localStorage, don't you be worry if your cards is reloaded against your will, because all the information you added, will be there when you come back :)
